# EasyShop-API-Capstone 🛍️🛒
This final Capstone represents the culmination of everything I’ve learned throughout the program. Unlike previous projects where I built the application entirely from scratch, this time I’m working with an existing codebase. The project is an e-commerce application—an online store developed for a company called EasyShop.

# Technology Used 🛒🛍️👨🏾‍💻
For this capstone project, I used `MySQL` to create and manage the database, `IntelliJ IDEA` to develop the Java code, and `Postman` to test the API endpoints and ensure the application runs as expected.
